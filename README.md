CS Problem Solving acoustics project- Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling

This project seeks to overcome the problems of voice intelligability in enclosed spaces by investigating and analyzing reverberation times through the use of cleaning tools, visualizations, and graphical analysis of user-given data.
Through the usage of a Model-View-Controller design architecture, the hope is that we can create a well-pipelined series of visualization tools and accessible scientific calculations so that the issues presented by reverberations can be analyzed more effectively and conveniently. 

Regarding installation, refer to the provided requirement.txt for a guide to the project's dependencies. 
Additionally, the installation of ffmpeg is required for this program to run.
